## 이미지 복구 알고리즘

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. Preprocessing: Load the dataset of black-and-white damaged images and their corresponding ground truth images.
   
2. Image Restoration: Implement an algorithm for denoising and repairing the damaged images (e.g., using neural networks such as convolutional autoencoders).
   
3. Image Colorization: Use colorization techniques to predict the color version of the restored images (e.g., using models like DeOldify or GANs).
   
4. Evaluation: Calculate SSIM scores between the restored/colorized images and the ground truth.
   
5. Submission: Output the colorized images in the correct format for submission.
   
Next Steps:

1. Processing the Image: I can assist with processing or analyzing the uploaded image for restoration or colorization if it is part of the dataset.
   
2. Dataset Handling: You would need the dataset (train_input, train_gt, train.csv, etc.) for training the model and testing its performance. You can either upload the dataset or run the code locally to train and test the model.
